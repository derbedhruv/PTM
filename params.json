  "body": "### The Problem Statement - origin\r\nMy mom is vice-principal at a high school called [Wisdom World](http://www.wisdomworldschool.in/) in Wakad, Pune. She needed to schedule a parent-teacher meeting for all teachers (from classes 3 to 10) and it was turning out to be a major headache to do manually (which is how they have been doing it for years!).\r\n\r\nI was at home at the time, I had recently quit my job at Hyderabad to be at home before I would fly out to Stanford, California for the graduate program I'd be starting in the fall of 2016. I had been reading a lot about algorithms and discrete optimization (the coursera course especially) and I was aching to try things out in the real world, so I told my mum I'd make a system which would ease her job and the many such optimization jobs to come.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
